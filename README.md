# Red-black-cryptography
This project is a implementation of IEE conference paper Red Black Tree Cryptography
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7154800
The proposed model is encryption in 3 levels using RBT
level-1:LCG model
level-2:inserting the indices of the encrypted sentence into RB trees and scrambling the letters in the level wise order they are traversed in RBT
level-3:further encrypting the letter of indices that are black node in the tree

Decrtyption:
It is just the opposite of the encryption process.
